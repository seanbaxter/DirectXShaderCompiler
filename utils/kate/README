  Syntax Highlighting Mode for the KDE Kate editor. To install just copy
  this file to ~/.kde/share/apps/katepart/syntax (or better yet, symlink it).

Note: If you notice missing or incorrect syntax highlighting, please contact
<llvm37-bugs [at] lists.llvm37.org>; if you wish to provide a patch to improve the
functionality, it will be most appreciated. Thank you.
