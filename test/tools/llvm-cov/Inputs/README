These inputs were pre-generated to allow for easier testing of llvm37-cov.

The files used to test the gcov compatible code coverage tool were generated
using the following method:

  test.gcno and test.gcda were create by running clang:
    clang++ -g -ftest-coverage -fprofile-arcs test.cpp

  test.cpp.gcov was created by running gcov 4.2.1:
    gcov test.cpp

The 'covmapping' files that are used to test llvm37-cov contain raw sections
with the coverage mapping data generated by the compiler and linker. They are
created by running clang and llvm37-cov:
  clang++ -fprofile-instr-generate -fcoverage-mapping -o test test.cpp
  llvm37-cov convert-for-testing -o test.covmapping test

The 'profdata' files were generated by running an instrumented version of the
program and merging the raw profile data using llvm37-profdata.
  ./test
  llvm37-profdata merge -o test.profdata default.profraw
