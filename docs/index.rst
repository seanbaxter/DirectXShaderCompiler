Overview
========

The DirectX HLSL Compiler is a compiler and related set of tools used to
compile High-Level Shader Language (HLSL) programs into DirectX Intermediate
Language (DXIL) representation. Applications that make use of DirectX for
graphics, games, and computation can use it to generate shader programs. The
DirectX HLSL Compiler is built on the 3.7 releases of LLVM37 and Clang.

The LLVM37 compiler infrastructure supports a wide range of projects, from
industrial strength compilers to specialized JIT applications to small
research projects.

Similarly, documentation is broken down into several high-level groupings
targeted at different audiences:
